This project is a dynamic photo gallery that lets users filter photos based on tags like city, state, style, and country. You can select multiple filters at once, and the gallery will only show photos that match all of your selections. Itâ€™s perfect for narrowing down exactly what you're looking for. The backend uses MongoDB to store the photos and handles filtering, while the frontend makes it easy for users to choose their options from dropdowns and view the results instantly. You will be able to see how tis processing is done under the hood. Every line has a comment explaining how the code works.
